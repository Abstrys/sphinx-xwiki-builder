Test Page Two

This page exists primarily as a way to test links between pages.

Doc links
=========

With Sphinx, you just use the ``:doc:`` role and the page name, like so:

* :doc:`index`
* :doc:`test-page`


Ref links
=========

I can also link directly to sections within this doc set, using the ``:ref:`` role:

* :ref:`test-admonitions`
* :ref:`test-tables`

Subsections
===========

Subsections in the docs are made by adding a toctree to any page. Here's an example.

.. toctree::

   test-page-2a
